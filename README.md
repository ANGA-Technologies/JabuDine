# JabuDine

JabuDine is a mobile application designed for restaurant management, enabling customers to place orders, make table reservations, and streamline restaurant operations. The app offers a user-friendly interface and leverages modern technologies for a seamless dining experience.

## Features
- **Order Management**: Customers can browse menus and place orders directly from the app.
- **Table Reservations**: Customers can book tables in advance based on availability.
- **Notifications**: Real-time notifications for order status and reservation confirmations.
- **Admin Panel**: Manage menu items, track reservations, and view analytics.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system.

## Technologies Used

### 1. **Frontend**
   - **Kivy**: A Python-based framework for developing multi-platform mobile applications. Kivy is used for building the user interface, ensuring responsiveness and cross-platform compatibility.
   - **KivyMD**: Extends Kivy with Material Design components for a modern and intuitive UI.

### 2. **Backend**
   - **Flask**: A lightweight Python web framework used to handle API requests and manage data flow.
   - **SQLite (Subjected to Change)**: A lightweight database for storing user data, orders, reservations, and menu details.

### 3. **APIs**
   - RESTful APIs will be developed for communication between the frontend and backend. Key endpoints include:
     - `POST /register` - User registration
     - `POST /login` - User authentication
     - `GET /menu` - Fetch menu items
     - `POST /order` - Place an order
     - `POST /reserve` - Make a table reservation
     - `GET /reservations` - Fetch user reservations

### 4. **Deployment**
   - **Backend Hosting**: Flask will be deployed on a platform such as AWS or Heroku.
   - **Database Hosting**: SQLite can be upgraded to PostgreSQL for production scalability and hosted on cloud services.
   - **Mobile App Distribution**: The Kivy app will be compiled into APK (for Android) and IPA (for iOS) using `Buildozer` and `Xcode` respectively.

## Development Approach

1. **Planning and Prototyping**
   - Define core functionalities and user workflows.
   - Design wireframes for user interfaces.

2. **Frontend Development**
   - Build UI screens using Kivy and KivyMD.
   - Implement navigation and user interactions.

3. **Backend Development**
   - Set up Flask server and create API endpoints.
   - Design database schema for orders, reservations, and user management.

4. **Integration**
   - Connect the Kivy frontend with the Flask backend via RESTful APIs.
   - Test API responses and handle errors gracefully.

5. **Testing**
   - Perform unit testing for API endpoints.
   - Conduct end-to-end testing on Android and iOS devices.

6. **Deployment**
   - Package the Kivy app using Buildozer and Xcode.
   - Deploy the backend to a cloud platform.
